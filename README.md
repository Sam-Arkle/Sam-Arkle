# Hi, I'm Sam 

I’m a **Research Engineer from the UK**, currently based in the **USA**, with a strong interest in **formal methods, machine learning, and research-driven software engineering**.

My current work focuses on **term rewrite systems**, including constructive and mechanized reasoning about abstract reduction systems. I enjoy building rigorous, well-engineered research artifacts and aim to continue working in **research engineering roles** that sit at the intersection of theory and implementation.

## ⭐ Selected Projects

### 🧮 Term Rewrite Systems — Agda Formalization
**Agda · Formal Methods**

A constructive formalization of abstract reduction systems and term rewrite theory in Agda, exploring a deeper taxonomy linking strong normalization, well-foundedness, and confluence.

- Formalization of generalized Newman-style results (a marginal improvement on Newman's lemma)
- An exploration on different notions of well-foundedness, with an emphasis on constructive suitability
- Paper submitted for conferences and available on request

### 🔍 Soccer Sentiment Analysis
**Python · Web Scraping · NLP · Machine Learning**

A personal research project exploring whether pre-match fan sentiment provides predictive signal for football (soccer) match outcomes. The goal was to deepen my understanding of end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data acquisition and preprocessing through modeling and evaluation.

- Scraped pre-match fan discussions from online football forums using Python-based web scraping tools
- Collected and aligned historical match data with corresponding pre-match discussion windows
- Applied sentiment analysis techniques to unstructured fan comments, aggregating sentiment signals at the team and match level
- Built and evaluated supervised learning models to predict match outcomes using sentiment-derived features
- Analyzed the limits of sentiment-based prediction and sources of noise in fan-generated data

This project emphasizes feature engineering from noisy real-world text, careful dataset construction, and empirical evaluation rather than assuming sentiment is a strong standalone predictor.

### 🐝 Beehive Monitoring & Data Processing Platform
*Python · Flask · MongoDB · REST APIs · React*

A research software project focused on building a **scalable backend system** for collecting, cleaning, and serving heterogeneous beehive monitoring data to support downstream analysis and visualization. Part of Appalachian State University's AppMAIS project: https://appmais.cs.appstate.edu/

I designed and implemented a **Python/Flask backend** connected to a **MongoDB** datastore, exposing RESTful APIs consumed by a React-based frontend. The system handled structured sensor data alongside **video stream metadata**, providing a unified interface for research workflows.

- Designed and implemented a Flask-based backend to ingest and serve beehive monitoring data
- Integrated MongoDB for storage of time-series sensor data and associated metadata
- Built REST APIs to support data access and visualization from a React frontend
- Implemented data cleaning and normalization pipelines to handle noisy and incomplete field data
- Processed and managed references to video streams for downstream inspection and analysis
- Emphasized reliability, clear data contracts, and maintainable interfaces for research use

This project highlights experience in **research-oriented backend engineering**, where data quality, traceability, and interoperability are critical. This project became a core part of an IEEE published paper (more information below)

The code for this project is in a private repository owned by Appalachian State University.
